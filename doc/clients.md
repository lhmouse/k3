## Connection Establishment

A client shall establish a plain, non-SSL/TLS WebSocket connection to one of the
ports of the _agent_ process, as specified in `etc/k32.conf`:

```
agent
{
  client_port_list = [ 3801, 3802, 3803 ]
}
```

The request URI is used to authenticate the client.

## Connection Termination

A client may terminate a connection at any time, with or without a WebSocket
closure notification. A WebSocket status code that is sent by a client has no
meaning and is ignored.

A server may terminate a connection at any time. Whenever possible, a server
should send a WebSocket closure notification. In addition to
[well-known status codes](iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xhtml), these
status codes are defined:

```
user_ws_status_authentication_failure    = 4301,
user_ws_status_login_conflict            = 4302,
user_ws_status_unknown_opcode            = 4303,
user_ws_status_message_rate_limit        = 4304,
user_ws_status_ping_timeout              = 4305,
user_ws_status_ban                       = 4306,
```

## Message Formats

Both a client and a server shall send messages as JSON objects, encoded as
either text or binary WebSocket frames. Fields of client-to-server messages are
defined as follows:

* `@opcode` <sub>string, required</sub> : Functionality of this message.
* `@serial` <sub>any value, optional</sub> : An arbitrary value which, if not
  `null`, will be echoed back to the client in a subsequent response message.

Fields of server-to-client messages are defined as follows:

* `@opcode` <sub>string, optional</sub> : Functionality of this message. This is
  only set when a server sends a message actively; when responding to a previous
  request message from the client, this field is not set.
* `@serial` <sub>any value, optional</sub> : If a previous message from the
  client had `serial`, this echos the value back, maintaining a one-to-one
  relationship between a request-response message pair. The server shall never
  send both `serial` and `opcode`.

## Client-to-Server Opcodes

Whenever `status` occurs as a response parameter, it may be one of the following
strings:

|Status Code                 |Description                                    |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
|`sc_ok`                     |Operation completed successfully.              |
|`sc_role_selected`          |Role is already selected and online.           |
|`sc_no_role_selected`       |No role selected.                              |
|`sc_role_unavailable`       |Role not available to current user.            |
|`sc_nickname_invalid`       |Nickname not valid.                            |
|`sc_nickname_length_error`  |Nickname length out of range.                  |
|`sc_nickname_conflict`      |Nickname already exists.                       |
|`sc_too_many_roles`         |Max number of roles exceeded.                  |
|`sc_role_creation_failure`  |Could not create role; internal error.         |
